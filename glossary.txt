Merkle tree: a binary tree where the address of each node is the
sha256 hash of its contents. Anything can be merkle-ized by replacing
its contents with a hash. Git is merkle filesystem.  Bitcoin block
header contains a pointer to the tree containing transactions. This
makes the block size independent of the number of transactions in a
block, and is actually what allows miners to use ASICs to search for a
small hash value. They're repeatedly hashing a constant size header.

Private blockchain (also permissioned blockchain) -- A txn basically
(you can say it uses RAFT). Hyperledger Fabric, Multichain. It's a
classic exchange.

Proof-of-elapsed-time system, designed by Intel, uses trusted hardware
chips that delay for long periods, as if they were doing proof-of-work
computations.

Proof-of-stake: instead spending $1000 buying mining equipment to
engage in proof-of-work algorithm and winning a mining reward, buy
$1000 worth of cryptocurrency and use it as stake to buy proportionate
block creation chances in the blockchain system by becoming a
validator.  Used by Ethereum "Serenity" (wtf is
serenity?). Proof-of-Stake was first designed and a naive version of
it used by PeerCoin. Different variations of PoS are also used by
BitShares, NXT and Tendermint.

Public blockchain -- miners compete to find small hash values
(Bitcoin, Ethereum)
